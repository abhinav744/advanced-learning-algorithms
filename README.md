# 🧠 Advanced Learning Algorithms

This repository contains my work, implementations, and experiments with advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It covers both foundational neural network concepts and practical ML techniques like decision trees, all coded in Python using popular libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

✅ Neural Networks (Forward & Backward Propagation)

✅ Deep Learning Basics (Activation Functions, Layers)

✅ Cost Functions & Optimizers

✅ Regularization Techniques

✅ Batch Normalization

✅ Decision Trees for Classification & Regression

✅ Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, MSE, etc.)

✅ Unit Testing for Custom Implementations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

scikit-learn (for decision trees and model evaluation)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for neural networks)

Jupyter Notebooks

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/abhinav744/advanced-learning-algorithms.git

cd advanced-learning-algorithms

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

If no requirements.txt is present, you can install the typical libraries:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter tensorflow torch

### 4️⃣ Run notebooks

jupyter notebook


## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand advanced ML and DL algorithms in practice

Implement neural networks from scratch

Train & visualize decision trees

Compare results with scikit-learn’s implementations

Experiment with hyperparameters and optimizers

## 🧩 TODO / Extensions
 
 Visualize decision tree structures using sklearn.tree.plot_tree

 Add Random Forests and Ensemble Methods

 Add practical datasets (Iris, MNIST, etc.)
